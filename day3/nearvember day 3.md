## front-end
Front-end is too hard to me :(. I almost know nothing about react and vue framework. Honestly, i really dislike javascript and html. But after debug and solving enviroment problme whole day, finally i finish it, although it is static and  ugly.

## problem
The first problem is how to import near-sdk-js, i only use near-js-sdk in node enviroment, and never use wallet in browser, but in [near js document]( https://docs.near.org/docs/tutorials/front-end/naj-examples), i cannot find how to use near-js-sdk and near wallet because i have no experiene in developing frontend. If anyone knows where i can find the detailed version of wallet sdk, please email me :)

After solving import problem, everything seems easy, the code is in the dirctory. To deploy it, you should input the command.

```
npm install http-server -g
cd /dist
http-server .
```
